About
-----
This repository contains a single primary notebook and an accompanying PDF report. Two directories are present for data and outputs. The contents are intentionally minimal and intended for reproducible exploration and demonstration.

Repository structure (exact)
----------------------------
Root of repository (exact items present):
- csv_files/            — directory ( for CSV datasets)
- output/               — directory ( for generated outputs/figures)
- ds_report.pdf         — PDF report produced from the analysis
- notebook_1.ipynb      — primary Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis

Quick start
-----------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/pradipta2005/ds_Pradipta_Khan.git
   cd ds_Pradipta_Khan

2. Prepare an environment (conda recommended) and install packages you need (this repo does not include an environment file):
   - Example (conda):
     conda create -n ds_pradipta python=3.10 -y
     conda activate ds_pradipta
     pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   - Or use your preferred environment manager and install packages required by the notebook.

Running the notebook
--------------------
1. Start Jupyter:
   jupyter notebook
   or
   jupyter lab

2. Open notebook_1.ipynb in the browser.

3. Ensure the selected kernel corresponds to the Python environment where dependencies were installed.

4. Execute cells top-to-bottom the first time to generate outputs. If the notebook expects CSV data, place files into the csv_files/ directory (create filenames/paths referenced inside the notebook if necessary).

Headless execution
------------------
To execute the notebook and produce an executed copy (useful for CI or to reproduce results programmatically):
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebook_1.ipynb --output executed_notebook_1.ipynb

Viewing the report
------------------
- ds_report.pdf is a compiled report (PDF) of findings from the analysis. Open it with any PDF viewer.
